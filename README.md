## APITIZER
As the name suggests, which is a play on the word appetizer, this boilerplate is a simple structure & code with minimal configuration that is ready to be used as an appetizer for your code as the main course.

This boilerplate is used to generate JSON, XML API, and HTML rendering.

Still under development but ready to use. Documentation & examples will follow later
